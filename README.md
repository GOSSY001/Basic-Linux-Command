# Basic-Linux-Command


Introduction

This project demonstrates my understanding of Linux fundamentals, including navigating the filesystem, manipulating files and directories, and executing specific tasks. I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish these tasks, along with screenshots and explanations.

Understanding Linux Commands

Linux commands are used to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks. Each command has its own syntax and structure, which is essential to understand for effective usage.

- Command Syntax: Linux commands typically follow a specific syntax, which includes the command name, options, and arguments. For example, the ls command is used to list files and directories, and can be used with options like -l to display detailed information.
- Command Structure: Linux commands can be structured in various ways, including using pipes (|) to redirect output, and redirection operators (>, <) to redirect input/output.

Navigating the Linux Filesystem

Navigating the Linux filesystem is crucial for managing files and directories. The following commands are used to navigate the filesystem:

- pwd: The pwd command displays the current working directory.
- ls: The ls command lists files and directories in the current directory.
- cd: The cd command changes the current directory.

Examples:

- pwd: /home/user
- ls: file1.txt file2.txt directory1
- cd directory1: changes the current directory to directory1

Manipulating Files and Directories

Manipulating files and directories is essential for managing data in Linux. The following commands are used to manipulate files and directories:

- mkdir: The mkdir command creates a new directory.
- rm: The rm command removes files and directories.
- mv: The mv command moves or renames files and directories.
- cp: The cp command copies files and directories.
- touch: The touch command creates a new empty file.
- find: The find command searches for files and directories based on various criteria.

Examples:

- mkdir newdirectory: creates a new directory named newdirectory
- rm file1.txt: removes the file file1.txt
- mv file2.txt newdirectory: moves the file file2.txt to the newdirectory

Executing Side Hustle Task 1

The Side Hustle Task 1 requires creating a photos directory inside /usr, creating subdirectories, navigating into one, and using the pwd command to show context.

- Step 1: Create a photos directory inside /usr using the command sudo mkdir /usr/photos
- Step 2: Create subdirectories inside the photos directory using the command sudo mkdir /usr/photos/subdirectory1
- Step 3: Navigate into one of the subdirectories using the command cd /usr/photos/subdirectory1
- Step 4: Use the pwd command to show the current working directory: /usr/photos/subdirectory1
